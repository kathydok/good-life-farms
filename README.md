## Overview

We're trying to make web apps for local farms, and to do so in a way that is self-sustainable -- minimal maintenance for those local farmers.

### Issue

One of our bio professors, Dr. G has a farm, which she operates with her husband.
The current issue is that platforms like Facebook Marketplace take too much of their time just for marketing.

```
For our challenge, we want to see the best prototype which addresses an issue someone on the team faces in a novel manner. We donâ€™t care about slides or fancy presentations, we will be solely focussed on the coding prowess displayed and the ability of the prototype to solve the problem.
Process:
